# ClipShare

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Project is under major refactoring**
>
> A large-scale framework and structure refactoring is coming in the short term: state management will migrate from `GetX` to `Riverpod`, and the database from `floor` to `drift`. During this period, except for fixes to bugs that affect usability, **new releases and pull requests will be suspended**.

ClipShare is a cross-platform clipboard synchronization tool based on Flutter, supporting synchronization of text, images, files, SMS, and other content across multiple devices.

  + Relay service: [ForwardServer](https://github.com/aa2013/ClipShareForwardServer)
  + Clipboard listener plugin: [ClipboardListener](https://github.com/aa2013/ClipboardListener)

## Project Origin

This project started because I wanted a clipboard synchronization tool on Android, but basically none could provide seamless background sync on Android 10+ and in public network environments (I am a bit lazy), so I decided to build it myself.

The iOS version has been added to the build process, but it has not been fully tested yet.

## Current Tech Status and Plan

### Current Tech Stack

- Flutter + Dart (cross-platform UI and business layer)
- Native platform capabilities (Android / Windows / Linux / macOS)
- State management: currently mainly `GetX`, with a later plan to gradually migrate state management from `GetX` to `Riverpod`.

## Core Capabilities

- Multi-device clipboard synchronization (text, images, files, SMS)
- LAN device discovery and direct synchronization
- Public network relay synchronization (Forward Server)
- WebDAV / S3 object storage relay
- History management (search, filtering, tags, statistics, Excel export)
- File drag-and-drop sending and sync progress tracking
- Security capabilities: app password, re-authentication, encryption key configuration, etc.
+ Rule management (currently pure regex matching; version 1.5.0 will support custom scripts and content extraction)

## Sync Schemes

ClipShare currently supports three synchronization schemes:

+ Intranet:
  + Devices in the same subnet are auto-discovered and synchronized via Socket communication.
+ Public network:
  + Relay service: data forwarding through a relay service.
  + WebDAV / S3 as storage relay, with a notification service to trigger change notifications.

> Note: WebDAV/S3 storage relay is still an experimental feature

## Android Clipboard Listening Notes

There are currently two main listening paths on Android:

1. System log method: available on most systems, but in some ROMs (such as some OriginOS), usable logs may not be available.
2. System hidden API method: hidden APIs are invoked via reflection in shell/root processes. Compatibility is broader, but it may still be limited on deeply customized systems.

| --- | --- | --- |
| Android | ✅ | Supported |

### Additional Notes for the services Module (Text Version)

`services/` is the core runtime support layer, mainly responsible for:

- Configuration read/write (`config_service.dart`)
- Database lifecycle (`db_service.dart`)
- Device state maintenance (`device_service.dart`)
- Clipboard and source recording (`clipboard_service.dart`, `clipboard_source_service.dart`)
- Sync and connection management (`transport/`)
- Tray and window behaviors (`tray_service.dart`, `window_service.dart`, `window_control_service.dart`)
- File sync management (`history_sync_progress_service.dart`, `syncing_file_progress_service.dart`, `pending_file_service.dart`)

## Internationalization (i18n) Notes

Project i18n uses the `TranslationKey` enum to centrally manage translation keys. To add a new language, the recommended steps are:

1. Add keys in `lib/app/data/enums/translation_key.dart`.
2. Add the corresponding translation file under `lib/app/translations/`.
3. Register the language mapping in `app_translations.dart`.
4. Add the new language in the settings page language options.

This ensures a consistent key space across all languages, making missing-key checks and maintenance easier.

## Development Environment Requirements

- Flutter `3.41.9`
- Dart SDK `>=3.8.0 <4.0.0`
- JDK 17 is required for Android builds
- Linux desktop builds require GTK and related dependencies (see `.github/workflows/build-linux.yml`)

## Run Locally

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Scripts

The project provides related scripts (located in `scripts/`):

### Build and Package

> Windows, Linux, and macOS require [Fastforge](https://fastforge.dev/getting-started)

- Android APK: `scripts/build_apk.bat`
- Windows Release (portable): `scripts/build_windows.bat`
- Windows EXE packaging (Fastforge): `scripts/build_windows_exe.bat`
- Linux packaging (Fastforge, deb/appimage/rpm): `scripts/build_linux.sh pack`
- macOS DMG packaging (Fastforge): `scripts/build_macos.sh`
- iOS packaging (unsigned): `scripts/build_ios_nosign.sh`

GitHub Actions also provides corresponding platform pipelines, see `.github/workflows/`:

- `build-all.yml`
- `build-android.yml`
- `build-windows.yml`
- `build-linux.yml`
- `build-macos.yml`
- `build-ios-nosign.yml`
- `build-notify-docker-image.yml`

### Code Generation

- Database code generation: `scripts/db_gen.bat`
- App icon generation: `scripts/icon_gen.bat`

## Database Code Generation

This project is based on `sqlite` and uses the [floor](https://pub.dev/packages/floor) framework.

The database framework may also be migrated in the future.

Steps:
+ If you need to add a new table
  + Add a new entity class in `lib/app/data/repository/entity/tables` and mark it with annotations
  + Then add a new DAO interface in `lib/app/data/repository/dao` and mark it with annotations
  + Then add the entity class to `tables` in `lib/app/services/db_service.dart`
  + Then add the corresponding DAO getter field in `_AppDb` in `lib/app/services/db_service.dart`
+ Modify SQL
  + Modify the SQL on the corresponding DAO interface methods
+ Modify version number
  + If modifications are complete and you are preparing a release or PR, please update the version number in the `@Database` annotation on `_AppDb` in `lib/app/data/repository/db_service.dart`, usually by incrementing it
  + Then add a version migration method in the `init` method in `lib/app/data/repository/db_service.dart`; note that DDL should be compatible with downgrade-then-upgrade cases, for example by using `IF NOT EXISTS` syntax or checking field existence
+ Finally, run `cd scripts` to enter the script directory, then execute `db_gen.bat` for code generation


## Optional: Self-host Notification Service (for Object Storage Relay)

The repository includes a Go implementation of the notification service: `go/notification`.

- Default listening port: `8083`
- Docker Compose example: `go/notification/docker-compose.yml`

Start (local Go):

```bash
cd go/notification
go run . -port 8083
```
